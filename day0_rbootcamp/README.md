# Day 0: R Bootcamp 



### What we will cover

- Basic package management, RStudio projects and the here::here command
- Programming & data structures (base R only) from the PSYR site
- The goal: reach the point that you can implement the Rescorla-Wagner model
- **MAYBE**: a bare bones introduction to git and GitHub???? (or is Amy doing that on Day 1?)



### Content that needs to be created:

- Slide decks to structure the learning around (with links to psyr pages)
- Exercises for students to complete, plus solution sets



### Notes:

- I don't think we should introduce the "frames" data in the bootcamp. If we're planning to use it as a running theme throughout the later days, it shouldn't appear until "day 1"
- We **aren't** doing tidyverse stuff here. No dplyr, no ggplot... yet.
