# Structure of the day

- Welcome and overview of the whole school (Charles, you are taking this? Like 5-10 minutes)
- Talking about workflow / folder structure / etc
- Talking about replicability - not a lot, but as a lead in to making code and data available, and preregistering (as part of workflow)
- Git, presumably, although I hesitate to do this given that I hardly use it at all myself (but it logically goes here)
- Experiments and MTurk: ethical and science issues, tricks of the trade, reputation, MTurkR
- How to put experiments on MTurk
- How to make an experiment
     - Basic structure of javascript, backend, etc
     - Walk through frames code with some left out for them (?? too complex ??)
- How to put an experiment on Google app engine
