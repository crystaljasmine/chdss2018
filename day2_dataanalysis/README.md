# Day 2: Data analysis

Assumed knowledge:

- Basic R programming from Day 0
- Some experience with online experiments etc from Day 1



## Part 1: Data wrangling and visualisation

- structuring your workflow (scripts, RMarkdown, data copies, git)
- janitor::clean_names 
- tibbles
- data wrangling with dplyr, reshaping with tidyr
